<h2>One-Punch Man originates the story of Saitama, a hero for fun. The ‘final’ hero, in a sense. Author ‘One’ builds out a fantastical world of high-powered and flamboyant heroes and monsters doing battle in uniformly destructible cities, alphabetically signified for simplicity sake. All of the superhero + Shōnen power fantasy tropes are here — the capes and swords, the shadow organizations and the dark underground armies of daemons, the plans-within-plans and the philosophical monologues, the power-hungry overlords, the anti-heroic ninja, the god-tier martial artists that transcend humanity with imperturbable personalities… But they are mostly there to be subverted, to be satirized and played with. Namely via the protagonist’s inexplicable existence, this complex world is circumscribed unto its endgame Übermensch in Saitama, already progressed past every limit. One-punching Saitama is the final hero within this kind of story’s formulation — an invincible fighter for good. But he is also bored because of it. He is anticlimactically punching out dark and evil gods from the jump. And though he wins every time, he feels nothing.
